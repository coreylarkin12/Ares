# Recipes

## Day 1

A controller has already been created called Recipe. Your job is to develop different views for a Recipe List based on the visuals provided in the `etc/Day 1` folder. 

1. One view is a tile view
2. One view is a table view


Model classes representing a `Recipe` and an `Ingredient` have been provided for you. **Do not modify or change any of the model's properties** for this exercise.

Recipe images have been provided in your repository.


## Day 2

1. Convert your existing pages to use a shared layout view so that each view is not continually repeating the site template.

2. Make the Table and Tile view have clickable links that redirect the user to a recipe detail view. Suggestions include making the image clickable, the recipe name clickable, etc.

3. Implement the Detail View for your individual recipe per the screenshot in the `etc/Day 2` folder.
