output consumption message ("munch munch," etc.)

audit log - preferrably as each action happens is updated

sales report - separate file when option selected, using method


unit tests


is there enough money to make purchase

is there enough quantity to make purchase

quantity remaining might not be changing


filepath sanitization - make sure file is in correct place

is multiple streamwriters an issue?
